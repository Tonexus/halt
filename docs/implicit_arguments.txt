Hybridization between the idea of global/static variables and effect systems.
Implicit arguments could hold things like memory allocators, async runtimes,
thread initializers, signal handlers, io streams, os syscalls in a similar
fashion to function effects that are parameterized. Could also be used with the
unit type to indicate divergence/nontermination or exception types for exception
handling.
