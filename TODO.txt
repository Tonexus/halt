short term:

deref coerce: &(self: A, deref: A -> B) coerces as &B

allow override of defs/labels with different types

medium term:

write up documentation for features in README

fix up more code samples

long term:

write a more efficient lexer/parser when readability is less important/language
specification is more stable
